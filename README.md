# Amazon-Clone-project
My first web dev project: a front-end Amazon Clone built with HTML &amp; CSS. Features a responsive navbar with search &amp; cart, product grid with multiple categories, and a multi-section footer. Focused on clean UI, reusable code, and scalable layouts. Next: adding JS interactivity &amp; backend.
